# My-Config-Files-for-Arch
This repository is used to store the configuration files of my Arch Linux system wichs uses the Hyprland tilling window manager.

In the future, i plan to automate the setup process. For now, if you want see how my hyprland setup looks, you'll need to manually copy files from the follder ```./.config/hypr``` in this repository to the same follder in your home directoty (```~/.config/hypr```).
